                <p>Towards the end of finishing my degree at UCSD, I stood at the precipice of adventure.
        in a month's time after graduation, I was to hop on a flight to Europe. Somewhere I had always dreamed of going, yet prior plans had always fallen to the wayside. It was a journey on which I would give, recieve, and experience much, and I found
        myself in times of much personal reflection, learning, growth, and fun. The primary mission at hand was to go to rural western Ukraine, where I was given the opportunity to volunteer with an organization called Lifenets by helping teach English to and spend quality time with
        disadvantaged children at a day camp there in the town of Виноградів (Vinohradiv).</p>

        


        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/9.jpg"></span>

        

        


       <p>The camp was to take about 2 weeks time, and after which, I had a month until I had to be in British Columbia, Canada to fulfill the honor of being my friend's
        best man at his and his fiance's wedding.</p>




        

        <p>First stop was in New York for a night and most of the next day. I flew into La Guardia and took the bus into Harlem, where I then took a southward bus into Manhattan to meet
                up with my friend Ariel, who was way nice and had a couch on which I was able to crash for the night. But before crashing that night, and for most of the next day, we decided to go out and have some fun exploring a bit of NYC.</p>

</div>




<div class="country">
        <hr id="Swizerland">

          <h5>Swizerland - Geneva</h5>

                <p>After having landed in Geneva on a 12 hour layover, I managed to make my way from the airport to the center of town. Even though I was quite tired from the trip, I didn't feel it much from the excitement of exploring a forreal European city for the first time.</p>


        

                    <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/swiss2.jpg"></span>



                <p>At this early stage in the trip, I found it easy to become a little bit more unsure and nervous from the incredible ammount of new and unfamiliar. If I weren't at a train station with an hour before departure, have exactly the next day planned in my mind, and was generally unsure of what was going on, I would get a little uneasy but still generally easy going. Not stressed, just not totally having reached backpacker nirvana as I did toward the end of the trip.</p>

        


        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/swiss3.jpg"></span>





         <p>So, I found my bearings, and I soon found a park bench on the other side of Lac Leman (the name of the big lake there), and I sat there for a bit just taking it in. I then wandered around for a bit in a sort of dream state of not fully grasping that I was really in Europe, and Swizerland nonetheless.</p>

         


        <span class="lg"><img src="img/swiss4.jpg"></span>

        <span class="sm"><img src="img/swiss6.jpg"></span>

        <span class="sm"><img src="img/swiss5.jpg"></span>


         

        <p>Walking around, my thirst had soon emptied the contents of my water bottle, and I was still pretty thirsty. Rather than blow 5 Swiss Francs or something (like 7 bucks) on a small bottle of water, I went up to a suspicious jet
        of water coming out of some rock above which was a small plaque with some perculiar scribbling.

        Aha! French! It said "Eau Potable", and based on my very rudimentary ability French, I took a bold step forward and filled my bottle. I wandered more around the city taking breaks here and there to sit and try to compute what I was experiencing and what more was coming my way.</p>

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/swiss1.jpg"></span><br><br>



        <p>My short time in Swizerland was coming to a close, and so I headed back to the airport. While waiting for my flight to Berlin, I tried to take a nap on some of the hardest, most horridly  uncomfortable seat/bench things I've ever come across. I imagine they were so purposely designed to
        prevent what I was trying to accomplish, yet I actually did manage to get some quick sleep. I was then off to Berlin, and during this flight, the pilot made announcements to keep us all updated on the Italy - Germany semifinal match of the European soccer cup which was going on in Ukraine.</p>

</div>




<div class="country">
        <hr id="Germany">

          <h5>Germany - Berlin</h5>

                <p>Deutschland!! is what I was hearing chanted by scores of
        drunken soccer fans while on the streets of Berlin in search of my hostel. I had to ditch the bus I was on towards Alexanderplatz because the streets were in a state of epic congestion due to these people flooding it. Instead of taking the U-Bahn to Alexanderplatz and going to my hostel from there, I decided to walk it from where the bus laid motionless trapped in a sea of cars and inibriated pedestrianry which included some guy standing in the middle of traffic with his pants down while his friends stood by in histeric, slurred German chordle. - But Germany lost that game.. I can only wonder what it would have been like if they'd won.</p>


        

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/bundes.jpg"></span> 



        <p>The next morning, it seems I'd managed avoiding the jetlag pretty well, since I got to my hostel in the Mitte area of Berlin the night before at around 1am, meaning I went to sleep when the locals did and got up with the sun. Well score. I hit the free breakfast buffet thing of toast, marmalade & brie, and I made my way over to the Brandenburg gate and the Tier Garten area.</p>

        


        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/de2.jpg"></span>

        





        <p>I spent the day wandering around recovering from the travel. I took a nap on the lawn of the Bundestag at some point and hung out with some at the hostel. It wasn't the largest hostel, but by no means small, and what I found out by the end of this whole thing is that people's willingness to randomly hang out and chill is inversely proportional to the hostel's size. In other words, Pro tip: go to smaller hostels where people want to hang out a ton with fellow solo travelers or groups.</p>


        <span class="lg"><img src="img/de5.jpg"></span>


        <span class="sm"><img src="img/de8.jpg"></span>

        <span class="sm"><img src="img/de3.jpg"></span>

        

        <span class="lg"><img src="img/de4.jpg"></span><br><br>


        

        <p>The next day in the afternoon I made my way back to Alexanderplatz, just a short walk from the hostel, and took the train to the airport in the south of Berlin
        (Flughafen Schönefeld). In the morning I was off to Budapest, Hungary where I would have this afternoon and the following day to myself until finally meeting up with the others in the Lifenets crew.</p>




        

</div>



<div class="country">
        <hr id="Hungary">

          <h5>Hungary - Budapest</h5>

                <p>So far, much of what I saw on the trip was a mix of things I was expecting to see and things of which I didn't know the identity yet looked impressive. To those I'd say,
        "oh there's a thing!" and generally take a picture of it.</p>

         <p>Once having scaled the steep stairway and emerging from the depths of the Budapest subway, the The thing that immediately impressed me about Budapest was the tremendous amount of these "things" I encountered. Especially old looking things. </p>







        

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/buda.jpg"></span> 

        <p>Everything was so old and big and cool looking and in Hungarian. Being able to speak English, Spanish, Russian, and German gets one by in many places in Europe, but Europe is very diverse and has things like Hungarian which shares no similarities with other European languages, and so this made here the first place where I had no idea at all what people were saying or what any signs said. So I was at the mercy of hand gestures and the occasional young Hungarian who knew some English. This turned out to not be at all bad and actually lots of fun and I suppose part of that european backpacking thing. </p>
        
 



        <span class="lg"><img src="img/hu1.jpg"></span>

        

        <span class="sm"><img src="img/hu4.jpg"></span>

        <span class="sm"><img src="img/hu7.jpg"></span><br><br>



        <p>I walked along the Danube river, crossed a few epic looking bridges, walked up a hill and saw plenty of "things" well after sunset, which was around 10-10:30pm here. At some point I got into a long, but surprisingly friendly, conversation with a Hungarian Jehova's Witness guy cause he came up randomly and asked if I spoke English. And I mean why not? I was just wandering as the sun set and know some Bibley things enough to have the conversation go both ways, and the biggest piece of advice I can give anyway is to shed your inhibitions of talking to strangers in as many contexts possible as is safe and reasonable. This is what turns trips into an adventures; especially for the solo traveler.</p>


        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/hu3.jpg"></span>

        <p>The next day, I went to another hotel, yup, hotel, not hostel, and eventually met the others in the LifeNets Ukraine crew. Oleh, Natasha, Lauren, and Colin had arrived jet lagged and bleary-eyed, yet Natasha's bags hadn't, and after a few hours of worry, they finally showed up over night. Colin was a boss and wanted to wander around a bit while the others took naps. Later in the evening we all got something to eat and then went north in the city and found a big screen on which the Euro Cup final soccer match was being shown between
     Italy and Spain. There was a whole heap of people there with all eyes glued to the screen. </p>



     <p>Waking early the next day, the LifeNets crew and I headed to the train depot via the Budapest metro; not without humorous difficulty trying to understand the announcements for
    the correct stop in Hungarian. Alas, we arrived at the correct train depot at the correct time, yet it wasn't immediately clear which was the correct train. After wandering around
    wondering, we eventually found someone who was able to confirm that the train we had thought was the correct train, was indeed the correct train. So we headed off for the
    border crossing towns of Zahony, Hungary and Чоп, Україна (Chop, Ukraine).</p>

</div>


<div class="country">
        <hr id="Ukraine">

          <h5>Ukraine - Camp & L'viv</h5>

                <p>The LifeNets crew and I arrived in Чоп, Україна (Chop, Ukraine) When we were waiting in the immigration line to get into Ukraine officially, Oleh made a point of going ahead first, since he is fluent in Ukrainian and wanted to best explain who we were. I was last through the line, and by the time I was stamped through, the last 3 of us were just waved on by while everyone else had their bags turned inside out in the customs check. due to Ukraine being a main thoroughfare for drugs coming from Asia into the European Union much like Mexico is to the United States, as I had explained to me. </p>

                <p>So being a small enough town, people knew the story, and once the customs guys got word of who we were, that group of Americans coming to help that orphanage in town, we got waved right on through.</p>

                 <p>Once outside, were met by the people who run the orphanage and camp at which we were to volunteer for two weeks. 
        we made our greetings and were whisked away in the van LifeNets had donated to this group years ago.</p>
        

        <span class="sm"><img src="img/ua2.jpg"></span>

        <span class="sm"><img src="img/uasign.jpg"></span>

        <span class="lg"><img src="img/ua4.jpg"></span>

        
 

         <p>At this point in the game, I had only fiddled with a Ukrainian phrasebook app on my iPod, and I was
        by that point only familiar with the alphabetic differences between Russian and Ukrainian and knew a few phrases. That was about it, and to me Ukrainian really just sounded
        like Russian I should be able to understand but couldn't. At first I understood only maybe 15% of what was going on when everyone was talking their local speak, yet these folks, and many of the young kids as well, do speak Russian
        quite well, even though their Ukrainian was even of a local dialect, and I was told is often slightly confusing to standard Ukrainian speakers from other parts of the country. This aside, I was able to get by quite well when
        Russian was being used, and it helped heaps in getting to know and relate with the kids and adults around me.</p>

          <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/uajoseph.jpg"></span>
          

        <p>A typical day here consisted of leaving the orphanage house early in the morning and heading over to the mission where the camp was held. We'd have a big breakfast together and then have about 45 min to an hour of play time and then be called in for "урок (lessons) and the first class would begin.</p>

        <p>Our goal here was to teach basic English to these disadvantaged
        children, the most basic to the youngest, yet provide some more challenging things for the older kids. The first lesson was for the entire group, we would start by memorizing something in English with which they
        had quite a lot of familiarity in Ukrainian, the Lord's prayer. We also taught the group English children's songs and went through the lyrics as well. After this lesson, we had a 45 min recess during which volleyball was a common activity.</p>

        <p>It was a lot of fun listening to the banter among the older boys and usseful for tuning up to some Ukrainian. After this recess, we would break into groups for about another hour and a half or so
        to be able to give different groups of kids more focused attention with English learning, even though much of the time the kids were learning a lot during play time.</p>

        <p>Since I was able to speak Russian and handle a few phrases in Ukrainian, I was constantly being asked how to say something in English, whether it was a girl running up asking "how do I say to Natasha that her hair is pretty" or an older guy
        playing chess and asking names of the game or pieces in English or any other random questions he/she wanted to know. As our time there progressed, the questions they would ask would even get more high-level and
        start to get into grammar and verbs etc.</p>

        <p>Our typical day would then proceed into having Lunch all together, followed by a Bible study. We then would
         ajourn for some more play time before we would go on an afternoon excursion. We would generally go to the Tisa river cause it was so hot and humid, but we also went elsewhere. Like one day

         We went to some ruins of an old fortress on a hill. It was insane to think about it when I learned
         that these ruins were once a fortress which was knocked over by the Mongols. The Mongols... the folks I've, until now, had only read about roaving the countryside of what may as well be a foreign planet in history books, and here
         something was that they left behind that we, a bunch of kids, were climbing and jumping around all over.</p>


        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/ua3.jpg"></span>

        <p>Our time with the kids at the camp had drawn to a close and a great time was had by all. I would miss the kids and others and especially my reputation I had fought hard to attain of being "swing guy", since I could push kids on the swing the highest. Oleh, Lauren, Colin and Natasha
        were off to somewhere west of Kiev to see family who still live in Ukraine, and their bus route went through L'viv, so without much forethought, I decided to tag along and part ways in L'viv. The ride
        over the Carpathian mountains was absolutely gorgeous and quite exciting as well as the bus drivers there tend to go fast.</p>


        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/carpathians.jpg"></span>

        <p>Once we made it to L'viv, we all got off for a break and I got my backpack from under the bus, as this was
        my port of departure with the LifeNets crew. We said our goodbyes and I walked away as the bus pulled out of the station. Right then it hit me.. wowa, okay. I am alone now in L'viv Ukraine of all places. Well, I have a month
        to get to Madrid, so let's go, I guess.</p>


        <span class="lg"><img src="img/lvivcenter.jpg"></span>


        <p>I found my hostel in the center of L'viv, all of which is a UNESCO world heritage site because it is just about the only medieval square that was never bombed into oblivion by either of the world wars. And here was a prime example of the budget saving good deal that is Eastern Europe, as for just a dollar or so more than a small coke would cost in Geneva, one could have a hostel dorm bed right in the center of town.</p>

        <p>Here I saw many cool things, the first day I went up to the високий замок (High Castle) and got a sweet view of the city. I just wandered around the city, making note of different things on the map I felt interesting enough to walk to, and sometimes I would purposely get lost a bit just to be able to wander around and see all the foreign things.</p>
        

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/zamok.jpg"></span> 


        <p>One day upon returning to the hostel in the evening, I met a friendly couple who were staying there as well. A guy from Wales and a gal from the Netherlands. Between them they spoke 3 languages, English, Welsh, and Dutch; however, that doesn't
        get you very far in Ukraine, as not many people speak English and practically nobody speaks Dutch or Welsh, I'd imagine.</p>

        <p>We talked and shared some of the best vodka I'd ever had. Local fare, not that turpentine stuff you find even among the 'nicer' varieties in the states.</p>

        <p>They told me how they were just wanting to get to Kiev and that they would go up to the departure board and just
        see a buncha times and squiggly things, being the cyrillic alphabet, and upon going up to a window asking "a train ticket to Kiev, please" anyone could only apparently reply "no trehn... no trehn zer". All
        this was frustraiting for them, as of course there had to be a train to Kiev, but alas, no luck. They then asked me if I would go with them the next day and help them out. Upon asking the ticket clerk for a ticket to Kiev, she explained how they were
        booked solid for the next 3 days because of the European Soccer Cup championship which recently took place in Ukraine and Poland, but she explained how if they catch a train to Warsaw, Poland and then back over to another city, it would get them to Kiev
        within a day. Done.</p>


        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/ua5.jpg"></span> 


        <p>Another time at this hostel, I ran into a guy from Madrid named Xavi. We chilled a bit and didn't mention where each other was going or anything, but coincidence has a way about itself.</p>

        <p>So the time came for me to move on toward Madrid, Spain. Hmmm what country is next to Ukraine, I thought. Poland, Okay, I'll go to Poland. So to Poland I went the next morning after getting my train ticket.</p>

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/leavinglviv.jpg"></span> 

        

</div>




<div class="country">
        <hr id="Poland">

          <h5>Poland - Krakow</h5>

        <p>Heading over the boarder into Poland, and thus the E.U. was an interesting experience, as
        the border stop would entail about 2 and a half hours of waiting. Not for the immigration checks alone, but to change the wheels on the train. Yup, as weird as that sounds, that's exactly what happened.</p>


        <p>The train would stop the first time once in Poland, and the boarder guards would get on and do their camo, german shepherds and automatic rifles thing. Even the dressed up passport stamp ladies in heels and skirts had a .45 strapped to their hips</p>


        <p>After this and another fresh stamp in the passport, the train actually backed up and switched tracks a bit. Coming to a stop with these hydroulic arm things
        all along both sides of the train, a guy busted in and told us move out of the way in order to access what is basically the 'train wheels come off' crank or button or something.</p>

        <span class="lg"><img src="img/arms.jpg"></span>

        <p>One could hear the hiss of hydroulic arms extending under the sides of the train as the train shuddered and slowly rose from the tracks leaving the old wheels below. Those wheels were moved away and a new set were rolled in which had temporary wheels
        that would later go away from the new set after getting off the Russian guage track. This is all due to that the Russian guages of railway are wider than the standard European guage of track presumably to be better for
        carrying heavy tracks and to prevent trains from the west coming into then Soviet controled zones and vice versa without needing 2-3 hours of heavy work and a means of keeping the train a captive audience
        for ample checking. This was just simply nuts. I had my suspicions, and hope, if this happening when getting on the train in Ukraine, but it was only ever a vague thought of 'maybe' from having
        heard it mentioned in a film and a book or two, making it seem only an archaic description of how things were done in 'the old days'. Sure enough, here it was.</p>

        <p>I was already really impressed with how pretty Poland was.
        My impression from history books of how it was a flat area between Germany and Russia (as well as France) which made it so conducive to be trampled over as those folks fought with each other.
        Yet this impression was clearly incorrect, my idea of it being akin to the I-80 corridor of Wyoming couldn't have been further from reality. Small hilltop vilages amidst the green rolling hills and open land was
        inspiring as it was beautiful from my middle-berth sleeper-train window.</p>

          

          


          <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/town.jpg"></span>

         <p>I arrived in Krakow and made my way to the hostel I had booked using my iPod back one evening in L'viv. I wandered the city a bit, and looked for cool sounding things I saw on the map. The Tour de Pologne (Tour of Poland)
        bike race was in town, and it was exciting to see parts of the race while I roamed about.</p>


        

        <span class="sm"><img src="img/pl4.jpg"></span>

         <span class="sm"><img src="img/pl3.jpg"></span>

        <span class="lg"><img src="img/street-4.jpg"></span><br><br>

        <p>The next morning I woke up and made my way to the typical free hostel breakfast. On my way over, I heard someone say, "Greg...?" It was Xavi, the guy from Madrid who I met while in L'viv. We chatted a bit in our surprise of seeing each other, and we
         found out that we had been planning to go see the same thing this day. Auschwitz. We decided to go see it together, and he mentioned that the evening before that he met two guys who were also from Madrid and that
         we could go over to their hostel and meet up with them 'cause they wanted to go as well.</p>

          <p>We all met up at their hostel where the other guys were finishing up breakfast. During this time, Xavi was asking me questions about
         what words meant what in English. One of the guys asked where I went to school in the states, and upon saying the University of California San diego, she perked up and said, "wait, I went there too and just graduated.." So, here I was, in a blur of crazy coincidence in Poland, and this girl was in the same commencement ceremony as I was.</p>


         <p>Anyway, so we set off to see Auschwitz..</p>


        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/gate.jpg"></span>


        <p>It's about an hour train ride west from Krakow and makes for a very heavy day. The first part of the concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau is referred to as Auschwitz-1.
         This place was creepy and made quite an impression of course, a place where the worst of human nature went ridiculous. Yet something about it somehow just still didn't seem quite like what one sees in films and history books about the place. Green trees which were green then too, intact buildings. The clarity came once we arrived at the Birkenau concentration camp. The, "what in the actual !#@%in' world...?" moment of shock came when arriving at this place. This is the huge one from the books and films, this place is
         just absurd and monsterous, that
        place was intense..</p>

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/doublerainbow.jpg"></span>

        




        <p>I managed to snap a fairly eerie picture on the way back to the bus that went to the train station. Heading back, with it having been raining off and on that day, and with the view of the this place in the foreground,
        the clouds were breaking and a vivid double rainbow streached over the place. Draw what allusion you will or not; it left an impression.</p>


        <p>That night, the four of us decided to reflect a bit but also to unwind from the experience. Let's just say we went out to a few bars and had a few beers. Actually it was pretty tame, they were the chill hangout type, not rowdy clubbin guys, so we fit together 
        quite well and we had ourselves a good time until about 4:30am when we headed back to our hostels having shared an amount of beers comensurate with the weight of the day.</p>

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/church-2.jpg"></span>


        <p>Xavi was going to hang back for another day and fly back to Madrid, but the other guys were planning on going on early in the morning. I did not catch where
        they were planning to go, but joking with them I said that they would never make it and that they'd surely miss their train. Thus we parted ways that night, and in the morning I decided it was again time to move along on the journey.</p>


        <p>I left my stuff at the hostel, and headed out to the train station to see where I would go next. I browsed the departure boards deciding between Prague or Bratislava, Slovakia. Just then, The guys from Madrid minus Xavi
        spotted me and walked up. They missed their train by ten minutes, but no problem, the tickets, without seat reservations, are generally valid anytime within a year for that trip. They then asked if I wanted to go with them to Bratislava to which I said, yeah, why not?
        They told me how strange it seemed how I was just standing there in shorts sipping a coffee going "hmmm where will I go next..." one saying that I seemed to have "el alma libre" (the free spirit). So I bought the ticket, went off to grab my stuff, met back up with the guys,
        and we were off to Bratislava, Slovakia.</p>


        



</div>




<div class="country">
        <hr id="Slovakia">

          <h5>Slovakia - Bratislava</h5>

                <p>The remaining guys from Madrid, Pedro and Marco, and I arrived in the early evening in Bratislava, Slovakia; however, Not without some adventure and near mishap. The train out of Poland was running late after having to stand on the tracks for 25 minutes, and we were to switch trains in Bruno, Czech Republic to get to Bratislava. We were watching the time as the train got closer to that transfer point, since things were looking more and more like we were going to miss it.


                <p>So we got to the transfer station, with no time to spare and there was a train across the platform. We decided to chance it and just run for it, one guy saying "is this even our train?" as we ran onto it. I was the last one in and was able to glance quickly at the side of the train just before running on and the doors immediately closing behind me. I noticed the "575" on the side. It was the right train. Good then. We made our way to the hostel by foot, as it wasn't far and there was still some light out, we settled in a bit, and then we went wandering about Bratislava for the evening.</p>

        

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/skk.jpg"></span>






                

        


        

        

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/castle.jpg"></span>

        



                <p>The next day was a bunch more wandering around the city, really not a whole ton to see here compared to other places, but nice nonetheless. Being close to Vienna, small coffee shops with great pastries weren't hard to find, so of course I had an opportunity to snap the obligitory 'eurotrip' small, european coffee picture.</p>



                <p>The coffee and the chocolate croissant did not disappoint, as well as the price, just a euro for each of these things. Even though Slovakia has it's own currency apart from the Euro still,
                Bratislava runs heavily on the Euro since Vienna is so close. Bratislava and Vienna are the two closest capitol cities in the world as it turns out. So I was able to hit up an ATM and feel the sting of Euros sucking my bank account dry way more quickly
                than anything ever did in non-eurozone countries.</p>

          <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/coffee.jpg"></span>

         
        <p>This was a surprise for me actually, that many countries in Europe which are in the European Union are still on their own currencies.  Prior to this trip, I had thought that if a country was in the EU then they are probably on the Euro as well, right?
        Nope. All the EU-nation currencies, the Swiss Francs (Swizerland not even being in the EU actually), Hungarian Forints, Polish złoty, Czech Koruna and Slovakian Koruna accumulated in my backpack thusfar taught me otherwise.</p>

        

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/corridor.jpg"></span> <br><br>



        <p>So it came time for me and the guys to part ways. There were vague rumblings of maybe meeting up when they make it back to Spain since I mentioned going there, but besides Xavi who we left back in Poland,
        these guys were going to be still traveling by that time down in the Balkans after going to Budapest where I had already been. So I decided the next logical place to go was Vienna, since it was so close and an alluring prospect.
        We headed to the train station together and purchased our tickets. My train left about 30 min before theirs did, so I was the first to go.</p>

<div class="country">
        <hr id="Austria">

          <h5>Austria - Vienna</h5>

                <p>I took the train over from Bratislava and arrived in Wien (Vienna) at Sudbahnhof station, as there are two major train depots going through Vienna. Sudbahnhof and Westbahnhof.
        I was then in search of my hostel. I got a 3 day vienna transit pass thing from the kiosk which was good on and of the underground, busses, and trams in the city. I had to make a bunch of transfers and at
        some point I mistook one direction to mean the tram instead of taking the same number on the underground; however, this was fine as a nice older gentleman started
        talking to me in German, asking from where I came and what I was doing etc. 


        asking me about earthquakes in California, until he asked where I was going and informed me that I was on the wrong mode of transit. Upon closer inspection of the
        hostel card's directions, sure enough it said U# and not S# meaning the U-bahn (underground) rather than the S-Bahn (trams).</p>

       


        
<span class="lgbr"><img src="img/street.jpg"></span>
        



        <p>Vienna was definitely a place of huge buildings, and it was nice to get back to a place I didn't have to squint at the signs to maybe only be able to read 25% of, as it was in Poland and Slovakia.
         The hostel was quite nice, and it was cool to see the sights of the city, it was a relaxing time as I did my fair bit
        of park sitting in all the flower gardens they had around.</p>

        <span class="lg"><img src="img/ridingschool.jpg"></span>
        <span class="sm"><img src="img/park.jpg"></span>
        <span class="sm"><img src="img/park2.jpg"></span><br><br>


        <p>After about 3 days in Vienna, I decided it was time to move on to Salzburg. Vienna, as nice as it was, wasn't a place for someone with little money, definitely a place to which to return one day when 'i have arrived' in life or something,
        but for now, it was time to go somewhere else.</p>


        <h5>Austria - Salzburg</h5>

          <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/saltzpark.jpg"></span>

         <p>The train leaving Westbahnhof for Zurich, Swizerland was a nice one, expensive as all get out compared to the clunky thing back on the Ukraine-Poland trip, but
        it was zippy once we got up to speed, 210kmph at one point (130mph), but before we got going that fast, the train was delayed quite a bit back at the station due to a track closure in town having to do with
        an accident or some kind, and with each passing minute, the countinence of those seemingly quite predisposed to grumpiness, aka. the
        Austrians and Swiss around me, got grumpier and grumpier until we finally started to move.</p>


        

        

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/saltzriver.jpg"></span> 
        <br><br>



       <p>Arriving in Salzburg, I decided to make the trek all the way to the Hostel by foot as a means of seeing the city, as the train depot was in the Eest of the city, and the Hostel was over on the other side in the South Wast. I passed through the tunnel to the other side of the ridge, made a turn left to the south
        and eventually found my hostel where I settled in for a bit. I think I took an afternoon nap here as well. Later on, while hanging out in the lobby, I saw a guy walk by who had a sweatshirt with the flag of California on it. Now I didn't expect him to be from there, but who knows, so I asked if he was, to which I got a reply in an Australian accent, "No, I've been there, but I'm from Perth, Australia"
        This was Brodie, fellow solo traveler and a great photographer at that. So we chatted and chilled,and decided to go grab some beers and a pizza or something. We decided we wanted to do something cool the next day.
        I suggested we go hike up a nearby mountain or something, he asks which one, and I turn around and point at Untersberg mountain and say, "that one." So we looked up the info and decided to give it a go.</p>

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/festung.jpg"></span>
        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/saltz2.jpg"></span>
        


        <p>We weren't completely sure of just how to get there, so German came in handy here. I was able to ask a shop keeper which bus went to Glanegg, the stop/town which was near the trailhead. Arriving in Glanegg, we went the
        wrong way for a little bit. We eventually ran into the enterance for an Austrian military station, and I asked the guy out front how to get to the trailhead. The Austrian accent was something to which I was not
        all that accustomed, so I was liable to not always get the whole picture when described something. After the guy described how we would get to the trailhead, I thanked him and we walked the other way. Brodie
        asked, "did you understand all that?" and I replied, "yeah, I think so, he said it is this way and that there is some bridge or something and two main trails to the top. One is the difficult way and the other is the easy way.</p>

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/untersberg.jpg"></span>
        

        <p>Well we again took a wrong turn, really just premature, as if we had kept on going we would have seen the signs for the trailhead which distinguished the two trails by difficulty; however, we found a bridge, so that made sense, but it had a big
        fence and gate blocking the way to what was clearly the trail. We hopped it, not without breaking the fence some. oops. But we started our way to the top, on the trail, which as it turns out, was the harder death trail which
        had shrines along the way for people who had fallen off the mountain when slipping on ice. Luckily there was no ice and everything was good.</p>


        

        

        

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/untersberg2.jpg"></span>



        <p>The View got better and better as we made our way to the top, and not quite to the top but close, we stopped at a small shack which was selling food and drinks. We then continued to the top where you could see Salzburg from way
        high up, as well as see into Germany where Berchtesgaden is. The view from the top was magnificent.</p>


        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/untersberg6.jpg"></span>
        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/untersberg5.jpg"></span>


        

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/untersberg7.jpg"></span><br><br>


        <p>We came back down off the mountain going the other way and had some pizza and beer at the hostel and just sat. Sitting felt so great at this point. During this chill time, I was on my iPod deciding where to go next, as Brodie
        was headed to Budapest in the morning, to which I had already been, and was thinking Munich would be a good go before heading to Prague before which I would go back to Berlin again to grab a plane to Barcelona on August 1st.
        Looking up hostels in Munich was death. They were all so expensive, and it was getting to a point in the trip in which I had to really start watching my cash. So where to go that's way cheaper? On a whim I decided to go to Croatia. Now I needed to
        book a hostel for there, and to do so I had to look up the name of the Capitol city, Zagreb, since I didn't know what it was before. In the morning Brodie and I headed over to the
        train station and got our tickets. We each had a couple hours to burn so we just sat and chilled and grabbed some burger king. Then the time came to grab our trains and we parted ways. I was off to Croatia of all places, with great view from the train of Austria
        and Slovenia.</p>

          <h5>Slovenia</h5>

                <p>The trip from Salzburg, Austria through Villach, Austria in the south of the country, through Slovenia, and finally to Zagreb Croatia was gorgeous. The scenery on this go is very much worth showing, as it offered
        excellent views through the entirety of the trip.</p>

<p>I didn't know what to expect in Croatia really, and I wasn't even sure of its status as an E.U. country or not. There was an Italian guy going on business
        to croatia in the same train seat area as me who offered me some food and who was also unsure whether or not Croatia was in the E.U. Upon arriving at the border, I received my answer, as it was the
        standard camo, guns and dogs treatment as was encountered at any of the border crossings in/out of the EU, except that what I noticed, is that my US passport got me through with ease whereever I went, while
        even those entering back into the EU, being checked by EU guards, seemed to be under way more sruitiny than I ever was. Weird.</p>

          <h5>Croatia - Zagreb</h5>

                <p>I arrived in Zagreb in the late afternoon, and after
        getting off the train, I went over to an ATM so I could get some cash since Croatia was yet another country not on the Euro. The walk from the Train station to the hostel was not a long one at all, even though it went across the city a bit,
        since Zagreb isn't all that large of a city, yet so far it seemed really nice. </p>

        


        

        

        <span class="lg"><img src="img/city.jpg"></span>

        <span class="sm"><img src="img/citycenter.jpg"></span>

       





        <p>There was this sense of a mix of old-world feel with many of what we'd consider modern conviniences.
        I ended up liking Zagreb quite a lot, I wish I could have spent more time in other parts of the country, but I had only 2-3 days here since I had to start making my way to Berlin by August 1st for the flight to Barcelona, and I
        wanted to squeeze in Prague before that as well.</p>


          <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/roof.jpg"></span>

          <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/cr1.jpg"></span>


        <p>In the morning in Zagreb, I took the train
        back through Slovenia again to Vienna Sudbahnhof station where I switched trains and eventually arrived in Prague in the afternoon.</p>

<div class="country">
        <hr id="Czech">

          <h5>Czech Republic - Prague</h5>

          <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/czz.jpg"></span>

                <p>Arriving in Prague, I decided to do the walk to the hostel thing again, even though
        this time it was quite a long walk. I stopped to grab cash from an ATM again as well as a cheap slice of pizza through the center of the city. Those cheap slices of pizza were great through this whole adventure, as
        traveling in Europe is quite spendy. Eastern Europe is a lot, and I mean a lot, cheaper than western Europe, especially the likes of Swizerland and Austria. However, one musn't fret, doing a trip like this on the relative
        cheap is actually possible. Sure you won't be eating out every night, some nights or days you may not even be eating at all. I usually split it up every other day style. On one day, I would eat the free or very cheap hostel
        breakfast which normally consisted of toast, cheese, and some marmelade and go throughout the entire day without anything else or maybe one of those cheap slices of pizza. On the next day,
        I would eat a little more and include something nicer and more indicative of the local fare and enjoy it more I feel than if I were gorging myself every day anyway.</p>


        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/hill.jpg"></span>
        
        
        <p>Wandering around this seemed to be the goldikocks city. It seemed to be a great balance of city size. Not too small to where everything can be explored in a day and a half, nor is it huge where, without living there a year, you would never
        discover all it has to offer. Basically the prior being somewhere like L'viv or Zagreb and the latter being Budapest or berlin. I enjoyed just walking all over that place, took the tram maybe once, but walking was very enjoyable since one is able to incorporate crossing the cool bridges and walking along the river or through the large medieval squares
        in order to get anywhere. The architecture was some of the most striking of the trip as well.</p>


        
<span class="lgbr"><img src="img/riverside.jpg"></span>
        


        <p>This place also didn't have a travel/hangout crew during the day, but at night, there were some guys at the hostel I would
        run into a few times. Two guys from Germany, one from Washington state, and another guy from France and I would generally end up hanging out with some beers down in the hostel bar until late at night. The beer here was great.
        The pilzners are all very good here and most are ridiculously cheap. I'd always heard that the Czech Republic is quite known for its quality beers, and now I knew why.</p>


        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/cz1.jpg"></span>
        
        
        <p>The time had come to head back to Berlin for my flight. I was getting quite strapped for cash at this point and was relying a little more than I'd have liked on my credit card, I wasn't totally out of cash, but I wanted to not spend it all and
        be at the mercy of just one card if it came to it. So here, I did what I probably should have done a few other times before. I took the bus from Prague, through Dresden, Germany and to Berlin instead of the train. Busses are way cheaper and
        sometimes can get you somewhere more quickly than a train would depending on the route.</p>

          <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/parcguell.jpg"></span>

               <p>Okay, Time to get all hipster now, since according to many of the locals, I wasn't yet in Spain but in Catalonia. The reason for this goes way back to a strong sense of nationality
                the Catalans possess. They speak a different language there even, Catalan. Some stores even would post the languages they speak on their storefront sign and would read, "we speak Catalan, We speak english,
                we speak French, we speak italian." No mention of speaking any Spanish, but of course everyone there did, but if you started talking to a local in Spanish, many times they would switch to English
                if they could easily tell that's the language you speak; however, I noticed that starting out with a little bit of Catalan, like saying "Bon dia" (good day) even if then to launch into Spanish, the locals were
                very friendly and smiles and would just stay in Spanish after that. Luckily, I had this weird curiosity with the languge a year or so before this trip and got one of those teach yourself books. By no means
        was I anywhere near fluent, but it made me familiar with the differences and similarities between it and Spanish enough to be able to read things and understand and speak basic things with people.</p>

                <p>Here I had another few people with whom I did most everything. Particularly Rafaella from Brasil who hung out with me the most during my time here. We went all around on walking tours, to the Sagrada Famila cathedral,
        food runs, etc.</p>


        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/peeps.jpg"></span> 

          

        <p>The next few days were great, as wandering around with friends in Barcelona is really nice. The hostel wasn't exactly close, but Barcelona isn't an enormous city, and the metro system is absolutely impressive, clean, and very efficient.
        This was one of my favorite cities throughout Europe due to the culture, language, sights and friends. One of the places to which I had long dreamed of going due to my slightly weird obsession with the Catalan
        language and what I had seen in some movies, and I was finally there.</p>

          <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/glass.jpg"></span>


        Yet all good things come to an end, and since I only had 3 days to go until my flight from Madrid, I went and bought a ticket for an 8 hour
        bus ride to Madrid.</p>

          <h5>Spain</h5>

                <p>Now I was in Spain. I took the bus over and it was an enjoyable enough trip except unfortunately at the end when I grabbed my backpack from under the bus I was confronted by a nasty bathroomy smell, and it followed me a bit.
        I put my backpack down and felt that part of it was wet.. not good. It seems the bathroom water had dripped on my bag during the trip to Madrid, as it got shoved around a bit from where I put it under the
        bus when back in Barcelona. No bueno. I eventually got to hostel after much use of the inefficient and monsterous Madrid metro. I can't hate on it too hard, as Madrid is huge compared to the likes of Barcelona.
        But that thing was still ridiculous with different tickets for different zones of the same system. Weird.</p>

        

        

        

        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/flag.jpg"></span><br><br>


        <p>Later on, I met Fulya, a girl from Germany of Turkish heritage who was in Madrid to find a place to live for when she'd come there for school in a few months. She would become my main chill and go do stuff with buddy while here in Madrid. We wandered around a bit, and on one occasion we went down a random street just for why not after
        getting some icecream after seeing the palace. There I came across
        something I definitely did not expect. It was the Spanish Inquisition. There on the side of a non-important looking red brick building was a plaque I decided to go over and read, on which it said, "..este inmueble tuvieron su sede El consejo supremo y tribunal de la Inquisicion.." (..this property had the headquarters of the supreme counsel and tribunal of the inquisition..)</p>


        <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/inquisition.jpg"></span>


          
        <p>We went to prado museum where we got in for free by our student IDs, and there outside I heard
        Albeniz and Granados classical guitar music being played by a dude which I grew up listening to, since my dad always played it a lot. And here I was, in Spain, listening to that music live. Way cool.</p>


          <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/thing.jpg"></span>


          <p>I went out to dinner with Fulya at a place we saw earlier on. A Mexican restaurant of all things called, "La Malinche" and everything was surprisingly of homemade quality and tasted way good; however, after this
        I was still hungry, so we went to a late night Kebab place after some wandering. When we got there, the owner and his wife I guess was able to tell or at least guess really well that she was Turkish, and so
        she started speaking Turkish with them. While I had no idea what was being said, we started getting free stuff like a really good tea and some kinda dessert while they chatted.</p>


          <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/palace-2.jpg"></span>


          <p>Eventually came the time to leave Europe.. I was a bit sad to do so, but I was also way excited to get to Canada to see Will, Alina and many others at the wedding where I was to be the
        best man. I had a long flight ahead of me, but the fun was far from over.</p>

          <h5>Canada</h5>

                <p>I arrived from Madrid in Toronto, Ontario
        for a 2.5hr layover. Of course the first thing on my mind as the first order of business was to hit up some Timmy's.</p>


<span class="lg"><img src="img/timmys.jpg"></span>


          <p>I then got on another 4.5-5hr flight to Vancouver where I would be picked up
        by a family Alina's family has known for years. I spent the night there, and it was absolutely amazing to have a whole queen bed in a room with only me in it, and a shower, that was amazing as well at this point after
        coming all that way from Madrid. The next day we all then took the ferry from the mainland over to Vancouver island and drove to the town where the wedding was to be.</p>


        <span class="lg"><img src="img/ferry.jpg"></span>

        <span class="sm"><img src="img/yard.jpg"></span>

        <span class="sm"><img src="img/illegal.jpg"></span><br><br>



               <p>The pre wedding time was filled with good times and
        the usual antics when G-Dub happens. Not tattling on William, as Alina now knows this story, but the evening before the wedding people were up late to all hours coming together in helping get the final things ready for it.
        At one point I call over to William, who was walking by, and geastured with my head downstairs and he nodded. We both went to the room where the groomsmen and Will were all staying each night and closed the door and just chilled.
        Will then said, "by the way... this activity is HIGHLY illegal right now." and not 5 minutes into this, Will goes, "okay, I am going to rewrite my vows on nicer paper like Alina wanted" and I started going over my toast.
        Just seconds after starting that, we hear Alina call out, "Williaaaammmm?" and come downstairs to which she opens the door to us hard at work doing what she wanted. Win.</p>



          <span class="lgbr"><img src="img/lighthouse.jpg"></span>
        
          <p>So the wedding day came, a really great day for sure, as for my toast.. naillled iiiit! and the party went on into the wee hours of the morning. The next day after some cleanup and some people already leaving, I headed out
        with one of the other Groomsmen, Trevor. We went to catch the ferry and drive on down to the bay area where he would drop me off and then continue on to San Diego. We stayed with a family in Portland, Oregon to have a night's rest instead of trying to make the whole drive in one go.
        But eventually, I arrived home, one and a half month's time after having been dropped off at SFO intl. airport where this whole thing began.</p>

          <h5>Conclusion & pro tips</h5>

          <p>So the trip had come to a close, a month and a half of adventure after completing my degree at UCSD and having moved home from San Diego. This trip will be one of the defining times of my life, and it definitely wasn't the most "responsible" thing I could have done; however, it was well worth it. Sure I racked up a few hundred on my credit
        card that I would rather have avoided doing, sure I blew through what money I did have, sure I wasn't sitting at home right after graduating stressing over job applications. But it was beyond well worth it.</p>
        
        <p>In short, I give this advice to anyone considering doing this or something similar. First, just do it, be prepared and give it at least some forethought, but do it. And second, and this can apply to many other things in life as well like relationships,
        business ventures, employment, education.</p>

        <p>Just as you feel you are ready to go, take a look at what you have, cut your baggage in half and double your money.

         <p> <h5>pro tips:</h5><br>

                <h6>Packing</h6> 
                A backpack - not larger than what would fit in an overhead bin <br>
                Clothing - 2 shirts, 1 shorts, 1 pants and socks <br>
                Walking shoes/boots - Good ones, as you'll be walking. A lot. <br>
                Money - Bring a debit card and use ATMs, best exchange rate.<br>
                Misc things - Bathroom stuff, books, small things.  <br><br>
                You don't need a lot. Keep it light, really. <br>

                <br>

                <h6>Jet lag</h6>
                When you get there, stay up until the locals go to sleep and wake up at the regular local wakeup time.<br><br>

                <h6>Safety</h6>
                Don't be dumb. Simple but true. Don't go reminding people of how WWII ended or do anything to do with Hitler. Keep aware and be careful of people picking pockets. Step into a store to check a map instead of busting it out so ppl can see you are a tourist. Only that kinda stuff really.<br><br>

                <h6>Hostel size</h6> 
                Smaller hostels are more conducive to socializing. Larger ones can be downright antisocial. Bonus: not all hostel life is parties and debauchery. most kids are there for the same thing as you. but those hostels do exist if you want.. <br><br>

                <h6>That Eurail thing</h6> 
                Those train passes can be a bogus ripoff if you don't stick to the countries included with the ticket you get. I've heard it can be a great deal for those 3-country thingers, but non-EU kids pay way more for one than their EU kid counterparts. I just bought as I went and mixed in some buses which are way cheaper than trains.<br><br>

                

                <h6>Eastern europe is cheap</h6>
                Western europe is more popular thus more crowded by backpacker types. Eastern europe is a bit less on the beaten path, but by no means vacant unless you go to Ukraine or Belarus or something random. It is also incredibly cheap yet still magnificent and perhaps even a bit more mysterious.<br>

                Ps. the Euro makes wallets cry <br><br>
