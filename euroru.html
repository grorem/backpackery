								моя первая остановка была New York(Нью-Йорк) в течение ночи и на следующий день. I flew into La Guardia and took the bus into Harlem, where I then took a southward bus into Manhattan to meet
								up with my friend Ariel, who was way nice and had a couch on which I was able to crash for the night. But before crashing, we decided to go out and have some fun exploring a bit of Manhattan.

					<p>&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After leaving San Francisco with a quick layover in Dallas, my first stop was for a night and a day in New York. I flew into La Guardia and took the bus, being driven by a very disgruntled and erratic bus driver, into Harlem where I saw 
								a guy looking into the bus, pointing at random people as it drove by, and gave the cut throught hand gesture. I also ran into some nice people with whom I chatted, and as I got off the bus, the disgruntled
								cussing bus driver got off his shift, and between his obcenities and irate demeanor, I said, "thanks man" and he suddenly smiled and said, "no problem at all, have a good one!", and went
								right back to his prior attitude. At least he doesn't displace his anger on others I suppose. I then took a southward bus into Manhattan to meet
								up with my friend Ariel, who was way nice and had a couch on which I was able to crash for the night. But before crashing, we decided to go out and have some fun exploring a bit of Manhattan.
								I actually needed to pick up an IPod touch, and as it was getting late (11pm), I asked Ariel if there were any 24 hour Apple stores in Manhattan, and she answered me with a look of surprise, as
								if there were any question. it IS New York City afterall. Before that, we went to the Empire State Building. We wandered around for a good bit and procured my new IPod Touch at the 24 hour apple store at something like 2am. The next day Ariel and I explored some more. Bagels, Central Park wandering, Battery park and a few other places until about 2pm when I had to make my way
								via subway and air train to JFK intl.<a  id="example1" href="img/passport.png"><img src="img/passport.png" class="alignright" /></a><p> where my Swiss Airlines flight would take me to Geneva, Swizerland for a 12 hour layover. I planned such a layover because there wasn't avoiding a layover for the price I got my tickets,
								and this way I would arrive in Geneva at 9am and depart at 8:45pm, giving
								me ample daylight time to explore the city some. Passport, Bording passes, and Ipod in hand, I sat and waiting for my flight to Geneva.
								The flight departed at around 6pm, and I had a rather squished flight on the way over. I was in coach of course, and I was in the middle section in one of the two middle seats with a very large man on my right. It was kinda rough, but
								my excitement kept me going.

				<a  id="example1" href="img/swiss/swiss1.jpg"><img src="img/swiss/swiss1.jpg" class="alignleft" ></a><p><h9>Swizerland!</h9> I had landed and managed to make my way from the airport to the center of Geneva.
				This is the first photo I took in Europe, and although I was quite tired from the trip, I didn't feel it much from the excitement of exploring my first European city.
				You can see the Jet D'eau (jet of water) shootin' up in the background behind that gazebo thing in the photo to the left. I soon found a nice park bench on the other side
				of Lac Leman (the name of the big lake there), and I sat there for a bit just taking it in. In curiosity, I whipped out the IPod, and lo and behold wouldn't ya know, there
				was internet. So I tinkered with that for a bit, sending emails back home and whatnot. I then wandered around for a bit in a sort of dream state of not fully quite grasping
				that I was really in Europe. I thought perhaps this was a sign that I was really too tired for health and should find a nice bench somewhere and take a nap. So I did. I
				found what had become my favorite fountain in the world. I had my small day pack and water bottle which I so wisely decided to take with me for the day, but I soon had
				drained its contents and was wanting something to drink. Rather than blow 5 Swiss <a  id="example1" href="img/swiss/swiss2.jpg"><img src="img/swiss/swiss2.jpg" class="alignright" ></a> Francs (something like 6 bucks) on a small bottle of water, I went up to a suspicious jet
				of water coming out of some rock above which was a small plaque on which was some kind of perculiar scribbling. Aha! French! It said "Eau Potable", and based on my very
				rudimentary French, the fact that Swizerland didn't strike me as a third world country where the water would be assumed to be quite sketchy, and combined with my thirst,
				I took a bold step and decided I could drink the water. My short time in Swizerland was coming to a close, and so I headed back to the airport, and while waiting for my
				flight to Berlin, I tried to take a nap on some of the hardest, most horridly  uncomfortable seat/bench things in the world. I imagine they were so purposely designed to
				prevent what I was trying, and actually did manage, to do. During my flight on Lufthansa, I seemed to look the part of a German, so the flight attendants asked me for my
				food option in whatnot in German and didn't seem to notice or care about my accent or maybe lack thereof. Then the guy next to me started talking with me in German. we
				carried conversation for a bit until I realized that his accent, while not bad, wasn't German. So I asked where he was from. Turns out he was from Hawaii and so we decided
				English would work just fine. During this flight, the pilot kept us all updated on the current Italy vs. Germany semifinal match of the European soccer cup in Ukraine.
