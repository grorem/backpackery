                  in the wind rivers range of Wyoming is a place known for it's beauty and, thus large crouds and mosquitos.
                  While at dinner, we were looking closely at the weather report and knew we were in for a wet trip. Lots of rain.

              <h6><b><i>The Hike In</i></b></h6>

              <p>
                  Last night's forecast seemed to hold accurate, as it was rainy off and on the whole way in. We ran into very few people
                  who all had the same thing in common. They were on their way out, and once coming into the cirque itself, pictured below,
                  it seems the rain had driven away the mid-late
                  august crowds.

              <h6><b><i>Coming into the Cirque</i></b></h6>

              <p>
                  Lucky! The rain was breaking during our hike over jackass pass into the cirque, patches of blue sky greeted us while we
                  got closer to our anticipated glimpses of the jagged cirque peaks.
                  The forecasted foul weather having scared everyone off,
                  our group was to be virtually alone in the cirque for our 3 day stay.

              <p>
                  screamed Daniel in the middle of the night. Since earlier that afternoon,
                  after a few good hours of afternoon sun, the weather turned for the worse again, and it rained on us without any give all night.
                  In the morning things were still rainy, but not quite as bad.

              <h6><b><i>Snow!</i></b></h6>

              <p>
                  With standard mid-August alpine temperment, the on/off rain turned into snow by early afternoon.
                  It continued to snow on us the rest of that afternoon and through the night, but there were short breaks now and again which
                  caused us to go into frenzied abandonment of the campfire's warmth. A scramble for our cameras and darting out from the trees to
                  enjoy the warm sun and take in the juxtaposed elements of a scenery made up by things both summer and winter. Plus, superbonus: there as literally just one mosquito all three days.

              <h6><b><i>The Hike Out</i></b></h6>

              <p>
                  Through the night, I was awoken a couple times when a few bouts of high winds started battering my small tent on the edge of the camp.
                  Presumably due to the shape of the cirque, I could hear gusts of wind howling down the peaks a good 20 secoonds before they reached camp.
                  We woke early since we had a long hike out and a long drive back to Utah. Looking back we could see just how different the cirque looked
                  from winter's preliminary grasp at the winds.
