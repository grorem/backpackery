                <p>Towards the end of finishing my degree at UCSD, I stood at the precipice of adventure.
        in a month's time after graduation, I was to hop on a flight to Europe. Somewhere I had always dreamed of going, yet prior plans had always fallen to the wayside. It was a journey on which I would give, recieve, and experience much, and I found
        myself in times of much personal reflection, learning, growth, and fun. The primary mission at hand was to go to rural western Ukraine, where I was given the opportunity to volunteer with an organization called Lifenets by helping teach English to and spend quality time with
        disadvantaged children at a day camp there in the town of Виноградів (Vinohradiv).</p>

       <p>The camp was to take about 2 weeks time, and after which, I had a month until I had to be in British Columbia, Canada to fulfill the honor of being my friend's
        best man at his and his fiance's wedding.</p>




        

        <p>First stop was in New York for a night and most of the next day. I flew into La Guardia and took the bus into Harlem, where I then took a southward bus into Manhattan to meet
                up with my friend Ariel, who was way nice and had a couch on which I was able to crash for the night. But before crashing that night, and for most of the next day, we decided to go out and have some fun exploring a bit of NYC.</p>
